## Features

- Records multiple sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).
- Logs data to an SD card in CSV format.
- Serial communication for real-time data transmission.
- Compatible with a wide range of sensors (DHT11, BMP280, etc.).
- Adjustable logging intervals.
- Battery-powered support for remote logging.
- Simple configuration via Arduino IDE.

---

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, or any compatible board)
- Sensors (depending on what you want to log, e.g.):
  - **DHT11/DHT22** - Temperature & Humidity Sensor
  - **BMP280** - Temperature & Pressure Sensor
  - **Light Sensor** (optional)
- SD card module for data storage
- Battery or external power source (optional for portable use)
- Jumper wires and breadboard for prototyping

---

## Software Requirements

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Arduino Libraries:
  - [SD](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SD) for SD card functionality
- Serial Monitor or any Serial Terminal (for live data viewing)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VarLogger.git
    ```
2. **Open the project in Arduino IDE**:
    - File → Open → Select the `maincode.ino` file from the cloned repository.
3. **Install required libraries**:
    - In Arduino IDE, go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries.
    - Search for and install the necessary libraries.
4. **Connect your hardware**:
    - Make sure all sensors and SD card modules are properly wired.
5. **Upload the code**:
    - Select your board and port in Tools → Board/Port.
    - Click the upload button to flash the code to your Arduino.

## Usage

1. **Logging to SD card**:
   - After uploading, the Arduino will start logging data to the SD card.
   - The data is stored in `data.csv` in the format `event_id,timestamp`.
   
2. **Real-time Serial Monitoring**:
   - Open the Serial Monitor (Ctrl + Shift + M) in the Arduino IDE to view real-time data readings.
   - You can adjust the logging interval in the `maincode.ino` file by modifying the `LOG_INTERVAL` variable.

3. **Configuring Sensors**:
   - You can easily add or remove sensors by modifying the `maincode.ino` code. Instructions on sensor initialization and data retrieval are provided in the comments within the code.

## Examples

- **Temperature and Humidity Logging**:
   - Setup with the **DHT11** sensor.
   - Logs data every 5 seconds to an SD card.
   - Displays temperature and humidity readings on the serial monitor.
   
- **Multi-sensor Logging**:
   - Setup with **DHT11** and **BMP280** sensors.
   - Logs temperature, humidity, and pressure data every 10 seconds.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **SD card not detected**:
   - Make sure the CS pin in your code matches the wiring.
   - Use a properly formatted (FAT32) SD card.
   
2. **Sensor readings are incorrect**:
   - Check your wiring and connections.
   - Ensure you have the correct libraries installed for the sensors you're using.

3. **No data on Serial Monitor**:
   - Ensure that the baud rate in the Serial Monitor matches the one in the code (e.g., 9600).
   - Double-check the connection and code for any errors.
